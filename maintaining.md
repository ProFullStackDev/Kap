# Maintaining

## Developing Kap

Run `npm run dev` in one terminal tab to start watch mode, and in another tab, run `npm start` to launch Kap.

We strongly recommend installing an [XO editor plugin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo#editor-plugins) for JavaScript linting and a [Stylelint editor plugin](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/master/docs/user-guide/complementary-tools.md#editor-plugins) for CSS linting. Both of these support auto-fix on save.
